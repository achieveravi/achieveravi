                <h1>Hello, I'm Ravi Mishra</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a software architect with a strong focus on UI technologies including ReactJS, Next.js, Angular, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                    I have extensive experience working with cloud technologies and have been providing technical solutions to investment banks.
                    I'm an avid learner, always keeping up with the latest trends. Recently, I've been exploring Python and its applications in agentic AI models using LangChain and LangGraph.
                    Outside of work, I enjoy long-distance cycling and participate in club-level races. I also love connecting with people and sharing ideas.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With a career rooted in software architecture, I specialize in building scalable and efficient front-end solutions using modern UI frameworks.
                My journey has taken me through various roles in investment banking, where I’ve helped design and implement robust technical systems.
                I’m passionate about continuous learning and have recently delved into Python and AI, particularly in the context of agentic models.
                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me on my bike, enjoying the open road and staying fit through long-distance rides and races.
                I value meaningful conversations and enjoy engaging with people from all walks of life.
